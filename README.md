# lsio-calibre-web-mod
Modified version of linuxserver.io's calibre-web image to include calibre into the image instead of a run-time download on container creation.

Using renovatebot, github actions and github packages, this should automatically track the upstream linuxserver images as well as calibre releases for the forseeable future.
